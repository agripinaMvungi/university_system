Pending kernel upgrade!
Running kernel version:
  6.8.0-1024-aws
Diagnostics:
  The currently running kernel version is not the expected kernel version 6.8.0-1027-aws.

Restarting the system to load the new kernel will not be handled automatically, so you should consider rebooting.

Restarting services...
 systemctl restart gunicorn.service

Service restarts being deferred:
 /etc/needrestart/restart.d/dbus.service
 systemctl restart networkd-dispatcher.service
 systemctl restart systemd-logind.service
 systemctl restart unattended-upgrades.service

No containers need to be restarted.

User sessions running outdated binaries:
 ubuntu @ session #1: gunicorn[17119]
 ubuntu @ user manager service: systemd[1376]

No VM guests are running outdated hypervisor (qemu) binaries on this host.
Already up to date.
